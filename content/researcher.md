## Raman Voranau

I have nearly a decade of experience in the cultural and creative industries. I worked in the museum of arts, event agency as well as in a not-for-profit organisation, where I administrated educational projects for the early career creative workers.

In 2017–2018, I completed the MSc programme at the University of Glasgow, doing research about digital creative workers and their international mobility. Currently, I am engaged in Masters by Research course at the University of South Australia studying leisure experiences of the video game makers.

Originally, I am from Belarus. I have a brave daughter, listen ambient music and 99PI, and read books on late modern history and non-fiction comics.
